# JavaScript Clock

Analog and digital clock in vanilla JS. Insipired by [JavaScript30](javascript30.com) project 2.

Added a digital clock complete with date. Click the clock to toggle between analog and digital.
Background color changes dynamically every second to corresponding hsl value.

TODO:

- Reduce amount of borrowed code
- DRY javascript
- Possibly add alarm and/or timer functionality
